# Python Generators: Efficient Data Processing

## 📁 Project Directory: `python-generators-0x00`
This project is part of the **ALX Backend Specialization** and focuses on mastering Python generators to handle large datasets efficiently using memory-friendly patterns such as lazy loading, batching, and streaming from an SQL database.

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement Python generators with `yield`
- Efficiently stream data from SQL databases
- Process large datasets in memory-efficient batches
- Implement lazy loading for paginated data
- Perform aggregation (e.g., average) without loading full datasets into memory

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **MySQL**
- **CSV**
- **Pymysql** or `mysql-connector-python` (depending on setup)
